Stochastic programming - mathematical optimization

The documents and code are illustrative examples of 
optimality and feasibility cuts from the L-shaped method 
in stochastic programming.

In particular, the feasibility cuts example in Introduction to 
Stochastic Programming (by J. R. Birge and F. Louveaux) does not 
show details of how the authors arrive at their solution. Those
details must simply be too obvious to show the steps 
(i.e. "clearly..." math proof/result).
